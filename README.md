<p>Above is mortality in the U.S.A. Note large bumps in the male population's figures around 18-25 years of age for much of the measured time. It is probably related to dangerous professions and hobbies among American men in that age range, though more detailed data would be necessary to confirm this.</figcaption>
</p><img src="mortality_swede.gif" alt="Sweden Mortality">
<p>Sweden has much more comprehensive (and longer-term) mortality records than the U.S. The flu epidemic of 1918 (among others) is easily visible as a traveling spike in the mortality rates of those born in the late 1880s through the middle of the first decade of the 1900s.</p>
<p>This analysis uses data from the Human Mortality Database at the University of California, Berkeley (USA), and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany (<a href="http://www.mortality.org">www.mortality.org</a> or <a href="http://www.humanmortality.de">www.humanmortality.de</a>).
